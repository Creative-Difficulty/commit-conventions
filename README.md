***The type of change, which is applied through the commit***

🛠 - A change to do with configuration files

⬆ - Upgrading / updating an existing dependency

🌸 - A change concerning aesthetics (e.g changing the projects name, changing icons etc.)

✨ - A small change improving developer experience or user experience

🧪 - The creation or modification of tests

### Custom Types
These is used for libraries, whose icon closely resembles an emoji (e.g. 🪐 for the popular Apollo GraphQL server library).

## Message
Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
